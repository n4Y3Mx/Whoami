### üöÄ About Me 
I'm a **programming enthusiast**, currently exploring the world of **Python scripting** and **web development**. My journey started with **HTML and CSS**, and now I'm diving deep into **Python**, especially in scripting and automation. 



### üî∂ Begining
Though now I'm grown up,  I started all these since I was of **5th** grade. Definitely it is more than just a subject‚Äîit's my **hobby**! I love working on **new projects** and improving my skills every day. Gathering skill is the sh*t I'm focusing on.
 I enjoy working on new projects, learning new things, writing code, and getting‚ÄÇbetter every day.


### ‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE
 Cuz I'm working personally and doing My Experiments a little bit privately I am not gonna be active here at **Github**. working  silently is my pleasure. I enjoy it the most.

üîπDefinately I'm used to with **Linux** . From thr lack of coins I'm here almost always. Yet I never take donation at BTC.
